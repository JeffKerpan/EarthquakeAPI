Q1 Project Proposal:

Describe your app in 3 sentences:
EARTHQUAKE is an app that Plots Earthquakes on Google Maps.
The user can choose a date(date range?) and magnitude to show earthquakes.
Once the earthquakes are populated as points on Google Maps the user can click on each earthquake to get information about it(Coordinates, Magnitude, Time).

What Problem does your application solve?
My app solves the problem of being able to easily search earthquakes by a date range and magnitude.  When searching the internet for earthquakes the user is oftentimes overwhelmed with data and websites to look through.  The EARTHQUAKE app shows you where an earthquake happened on Google Maps and allows the user to click on the particular earthquake event to get basic information about that earthquake.  This app could be particularly useful for younger school children who are learning about earthquakes and/or geology.  It is a more basic and simple representation of earthquakes.   

What technology are you using?
CSS
HTML
JavaScript
jQuery

MVP Goals:
User Input Boxes to choose which earthquakes to display
Date(or Date Range)
Magnitude
Possible Slider for Mag
When user clicks on a earthquake data point it pops up a box with information about said earthquake
Coordinates, Date & Time, Magnitude
Splash page that uses CSS to shake the page upon loading
If possible get it to create a crack diagonally through the page and split the word EARTHQUAKE

Stretch Goals:
Use Circles on Google Maps
Emphasize & Show magnitude of earthquakes
Use Heatmaps on Google Maps
Be able to switch between Points, Circles and Heatmaps on Google Maps
Have a selector(box) of each beneath the Google Map
Connect with Wiki API to have links for each earthquake event populate in the Google Maps Infoboxes
Have the link to the Wiki article for that particular earthquake if available
